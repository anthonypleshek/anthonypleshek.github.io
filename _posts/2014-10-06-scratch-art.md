Digital version of [scratch art](https://www.google.com/search?q=scratch+art), which is a essentially a piece of paper with underlying color, sometimes bright and crazy, covered by a layer of black wax. The digital form of this is definitely not as much fun as the tangible version, but it was fun to put together.

This was built with [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) sometime around fall of 2013. Check it out on [github](https://github.com/anthonypleshek/processingjs-scratch-art).
