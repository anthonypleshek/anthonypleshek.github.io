I'm amazingly great at failing to follow through on my intentions of writing blog posts. In an effort to get some of the things out of my head that I've been thinking about, I'm going to lump a bunch of thoughts I've been having over the past year or so into one post.

### Post Inspiration
The inspiration for this particular post (aside from me just wanting to get some thoughts out of my head), is that I haven't been able to find much of anything online in the way of consistent User Experience Engineering blogs/posts/articles. At the time of writing, [uxengineer.com](http://uxengineer.com/) consists simply of a Google survey asking what the site should contain. It's fairly easy to find articles like "What is User Experience Engineering?" or "What is a User Experience Developer?" while being nearly impossible to find anything that talks about what the day-to-day activities of an individual with such a title are.

### How I Got Here
Since I graduated in 2011 with a B.S. in Software Engineering, I've been working at the crossroads of development and design. At Spreenkler, a creative agency where I worked from the summer of 2011 until early 2014, I had the privilege of working directly with a team of UI/UX designers on a variety of projects. There were a number of hurdles to get over while learning how to get everyone to effectively work together. As time went on at Spreenkler, I began to have the urge to become more involved in the UX side of things versus focusing solely on the software side of projects. The experiences at Spreenkler eventually culminated into the User Experience Engineer role I'm in now at Catalyze.

### On Working Closely with a Design Team as a Full Time Developer
The first couple of years after I graduated was spent doing development for basically 100% of my time. The work that Spreenkler was doing relied very heavily on creating great experiences, so I had to learn how to
work closely with the visual and user experience designers. One of the best things we figured out as a team was to, after most of development was done and designs had been implemented, have a developer and a designer sit side by side to make any final corrections to spacing, font sizing, colors, and any other common cleanup tasks. This step made finalizing UI implementation significantly faster, easier, and much more enjoyable than going through iterations of review, design sending back notes, and making the fixes.

The most valuable aspect of the process of having a developer and designer working literally side by side was in the fact that both the developer and the designer are able to get a much better feel for how the other works. Eventually both sides can use similar terminology, the designer can get a better sense of what is easy versus what is difficult for developers, developers can get a better sense of why visual decisions are made, and there are invaluable cultural benefits from this process. I've found that when designers and developers are able to understand each other better, know a bit more about each other's common struggles, and realize that everyone wants to end up creating a great product and appease stakeholders, the work is much more enjoyable, and there is better sense of being on a team.

Take my experience working as a developer side-by-side with a designer with a grain of salt as the company was very small. Your mileage may vary when attempting something similar in larger team environments.

### On Working on a Team with Multidisciplinary Individuals
The tl;dr of this is to play to the strengths of the team members. At Catalyze, I split my time between development (mostly angular) and UX (everything from creating wireframes and prototyping to user testing and interviews). Our design and engineering teams are still fairly small, so, like most small companies, we each have to do a variety of different jobs depending on needs at any particular time. What we've learned over time has been how to divide work up and when to pass projects off to other members of the team. This, of course, depends greatly on the makeup of any particular team and is likely to change over time as the team grows and matures. (For an excellent read on how to grow as an individual as a company grows, [this article](http://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/) is absolutely phenomenal.)

While it might seem obvious that focusing on the strengths of team members is the best way to get things done, it's good to always keep it in the back of your head and to discuss how to divide up work with the team so everyone is comfortable and knows what to expect.

### Conclusion
I have some more thoughts related to UX engineering that I'll eventually write up as well. In the meantime, I plan on continuing my search for a good resource or set of resources related to UX engineering. If you're reading this and know of any good resources or are interested in hearing more from me about my experiences on any particular topic, please let me know via twitter or email.
