I'm incredibly good at coming up with something to work on, starting work on that thing, and quitting before getting to any sort of "completed" state. This isn't the worst thing that could happen, and at least I know I'm not alone: ["On starting" blog post](http://bobulate.com/post/99311262439/on-starting).

As stated in the "On starting" post, it's totally okay to start things and not finish them. However, leaving half-baked or semi-implemented ideas on my computer and not sharing them with anyone probably isn't as good as throwing them out into the world, even if they look like complete garbage or don't work entirely (or at all). Maybe they'll be helpful to someone in some way, and hopefully it will help me get better at creating things.
